- [ ] Execution pipeline can execute nodes in correct order
- [ ] Validation system catches invalid nodes
- [ ] Mock nodes work for testing
- [ ] Configuration system manages node settings
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage

- `async-mutex` - For thread safety

## **Estimated Time**

- **Base Interface**: 2-3 hours
- **Node Registry**: 4-5 hours

**VERIFICATION:**
This plan provides a comprehensive foundation for the node system that will support all future game nodes and ensure robust, testable, and maintainable code.

**NOTES FOR FUTURE:**
- The node system is the core abstraction that everything else depends on
- Mock nodes will be essential for testing and development
- The execution pipeline will handle complex execution scenarios
- Validation system will prevent runtime errors and ensure system integrity

Would you like me to start implementing this plan, beginning with the base node interface?
